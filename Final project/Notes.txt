    - Description:
        - AGROTS is a real dataset, containing information concerning a series of environmental factors, collected by IoT devices for a period of approximately 2 years.
        - The dataset was previously processed by eliminating noises caused by measurement errors, resampling data by hour and performing a linear interpolation to fill N/A values.
    - Features:
        - Timestamp - timestamp indicating the date and hour when the information was collected
        - AirPressure - atmospheric pressure
        - AirTemperatureA - air temperature (measured in a point A)
        - AirHumidity - air humidity
        - AirTemperatureB - air temperature (measured in a point B)
        - V450, B500, G550, Y570, O600, R650 - luminosity associated to each color (violet, blue, green, yellow, orange and red)
        - SoilTemperatureA - soil temperature (measured in a point A)
        - SoilTemperatureB - soil temperature (measured in a point B)
        - TotalLuminosity - total luminosity (measured without using a color filter)
    Plan:
        - Apply interpolation to predict air pressure using air temperature A
        - Apply interpolation to predict air pressure using soil temperature B
        - Apply interpolation to predict air pressure using air humidity
    Updated plan:
        - Everything from the first plan but use linear regression
    Observed relationships:
        - Soil temperature A, Air temperature A
        - Soil temperature B, Air temperature B
        - All the wavelengths
    Potential updates:
        - Add interpolation calculations as well to the raw form of the data

Research goal:
Predict air pressure using air temperature A, air temperature B, air humidity.
